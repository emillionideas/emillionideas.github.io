Dear visitors,

Thank you for stopping by **emillionideas.com**. This website started as my New Year resolution to not only advance my skillset but also begin building a new aspect of my personal brand.

Ever since I started my first Japanese class, I have been admiring the beauty of this language, and wanting to create a tool that teaches its alphabets. As a designer, one of the things I love to do is putting together puzzle pieces of ideas and turning them into a project. It creates a fun environment for me to learn new skills, and work on something I love. After a while of putting it off, eventually, many things happening in the last few months of 2023 made me realize there's no time like the present to start my dream project.

Emillionideas.com was born as the first website that I am involved fully in both design and web development aspects. No matter what happens, I am grateful that my passion for design always be here with me.

I wish you a happy New Year and things are rolling your way in 2024. 

Warmly,

E.T.
